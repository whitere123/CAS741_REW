This is the SpecSearch Software Package. 

In order to create the desired spectral plots you must follow the following instructions: 
1) Download all 5 .mat files from this directory and save them all in the same directory on your machine. 
2) Open the SpectralProgram script. This is the main script. 
3) Run Spectral Program (ensure that the correct path to all .mat files is specficied) 
4) You will be prompted for a vector of the form [k N P] at the command line. You must input a row vector of the form [k N P] with k: (0,1)
, N a natural number larger than 20 and P is either 2 or 4. For optimal results set P=4, this is because P=4 is the min period for the cn 
periodic function. P=2 will suffice for dn.
5) After typing in [k N P] press the return key.
6) You should see 6 plots.
7) Fill out the surverys from the system VnV plan. The systVnVPlan can be found in this repository. Send the completed survey to whitere@mcmaster.ca
