This document discusses the verification and validation requirements for 
SpecSearch. The Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK) guide provides 
unambigious definitions for verification and validation. It defines 
verification as "the evaluation of whether or not a product, service, or system 
complies with a regulation, requirement, specification, or imposed condition. 
It is often an internal process". It defines validation as "the assurance that 
a product, service, or system meets the needs of the customer and other 
identified stakeholders. It often involves acceptance and suitability with 
external customers." (PMBOK) After reading this document one should be able to 
create and run test cases to verify and validate SpecSearch. 

\section{General Information}

\subsection{Summary}

The software being tested is called SpecSearch. SpeacSearch will search for the 
spectrum of a particular lax equation from a lax pair that is compatbilible 
with solutions to the Non-Linear Schrodinger (NLS) Equation. It will also use 
the spectral information to determine the stability of the solutions. See the 
instance models in the SRS for more details.
\subsection{Objectives}

	The qualities that are most important for SpecSearch are highlighted in 
	this section. Many of these qualities are also presented in the SRS. \\
	
	My supervisor and I intend to use this program as a tool to search for the 
	continuous spectrum of the previously mentioned specral problem. SpecSearch 
	will only provide the approximate 
	location of the spectrum and a finite number of elements in the spectrum. 
	We will 
	use this output as a guide in analytically solving for the 
	entire continuous spectrum.  Therefore, the 
	code should be reliable and accurate within my supervisor's standards. An 
	unreliable and inaccurate output will provide a misleading direction for 
	the next stage of our research. \\ 
	
	There are various numerical methods that can be used to locate the 
	spectrum. My supervisor and I intend to experiment with these different 
	methods in an attempt to create a more accurate picture of the spectrum. 
	Therefore, it is important that SpecSeach is maintainabilible and 
	manageable. This will allow for easy implementation of new algorithms. \\
	
	 SpecSearch will also be used by a team of researchers studying modulated 
	 wave packets and rogue waves. These users may not have a strong software 
	 developing background. Therefore, it is important that the code is easy to 
	 use and has a simple user interface. \\
	 
	 The objectives are summarized in the following points for easy reference. 
	 The objectives are to:
	
\begin{itemize}
	\item Build confidence in software correctness.
	\item Ensure maintainability and manageability 
	\item Satisfy the requirements of my thesis supervisor and those outlined 
	in the SRS. 
	\item Verify effectiveness and ease of use (usability).	
\end{itemize}

\section{Plan}
	
\subsection{Verification and Validation Team}

The verification and validation team consists of my theis supervisor, Dr. 
Dmitry Pelinovsky, and I. \\

\subsection{SRS Verification Plan}

The SRS verification plan consists of feedback from my thesis supervisor, Dr. 
Smith and CAS 741 classmates. My supervisor will provide feedback regarding 
mathematical theory, model assumptions, constraints and research goals. 
Feedback from classmates and Dr. Smith will criticize the document outline, 
readability and requirements. \\

\subsection{Design Verification Plan}

The design verification plan will simply involve inspection of the software by 
my thesis supervisor. \\ 

\subsection{Implementation Verification Plan}

The implementation and verification plan consists of two parts. The first part 
is a software verification checklist. The checklist will be completed by 
researchers who use SpecSearch for their research, my supervisor and I. The 
checklist sees if basic software features have been implemented successfully, 
such as 
allowing the user to fufill their responsibilities or if the software fufilled 
its basic responsibilities (ie plotting something that resembles a spectrum). 
The checklist can be found in the appendix. The 
second part involves running software tests 
outlined in sections 5 and 6. Unit testing will also be performed. 

\subsection{Software Validation Plan}

This section does not apply to SpecSearch. 

\section{System Test Description}
	
\subsection{Tests for Functional Requirements}

\begin{enumerate}
\item{test-Rin1\\}	
				
Initial State: -
					
Input: See "data input tables" in the appendix for more detail.
					
Output: Error or pass message.
					
How test will be performed: Combinations of inputing non-numerical values as 
input  (such as letters), or numerical values outside of their respective 
constraints, will be considered. A successful test in these instances will be 
an error message. \\
I will also test cases with each variable in the input having an 
acceptable numerical value. A successful test in this case will be a pass 
message. 
					
\item{test-Rfind1} 

Initial State: - 

Input: Similar to test-Rin1

Output: Binary output (Full or non-full array)

How the test will be performed: A test is successful if the amount of 
eigenvalues is equal to $2n$ and if each element of the eigenvalue array is 
non-empty. Unsuccessful cases from test-Rin1 should produce no eigenvalue array 
or an empty eigenvalue array. We are not testing for accuracy in this test; see 
nonfunctional tests for more detail. 

\item{test-Rcon1} 

Initial State: -

Input: Similar to test-Rin1

Output: Binary Variable (Connected or disconnected)

How test will be performed: This test will check to see if there is a 
sufficient amount of points between the tagged portions of the spectrum. Tagged 
portions are the explicitly calculated eigenvalues from the previous test. The 
spectrum array should have approximated values between these "tagged portions". 
Failed test cases from test-Rin1 should have no data for this section. 
We are not testing for accuracy in this test. 

\item{test-Rplt} 

Initial State: -

Input: Similar to test-Rin1 

Output: Pass of fail message (Is there a graph or not)

How test will be performed: This test will simply check to see if the spectrum 
is plotted and if the picture agrees with the numbers in the spectrum array. 
These should be no plot for the failed test cases of test-Rin1. 

\item{test-Rstl} 

Initial State: -

Input: Similar to test-Rin1 

Output: Binary Variable (Verification of stability) 

How test will be performed: The stability results will be compared with the 
stability analysis in (ref1). 

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Tests for Nonfunctional Requirements}

\begin{enumerate}

\item{test-NFR1\\}

Type: Static
					
Initial State: -
					
Input/Condition: SpecSearch MATLAB code
					
Output/Result: Pass or Fail
					
How test will be performed: The software will be manually read by the developer 
and his supervisor to see if there is a more effective code structure to allow 
implementation of 
new numerical algorithms. 

\item{test-NFR2a\\} 

Type: Manual 

Initial State: Software system with prescribed input.

Input: Matrix derived from the time indepent lax equation.

Output: Pass or fail (See "Matrix Structure" in appendix).

How test will be performed: The matrix output ought to have a specific form for 
each instance of SpecSearch. This test will loop through each element of the 
matrix to ensure it has the correct form (ie two of the quadrants are diagonal 
matrices and the other have a certain 'diagonal pattern') 

\item{test-NFR2b\\} 

Type: Manual 

Initial State: Software system with prescribed input.

Input: See data input tables in the appendix for more detail.

Output: Pass or fail.

How test will be performed: The output will be tested against the boundary 
value eigen-values derived analytically in Deconinck and Segal. The standard of 
necessary accuracy will be determined by my supervisor. \\ 

\end{enumerate}

\section{Static Verification Techniques}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Code inspection : I will 
	go through the code to see if each step is correct with respect to the
	mathematical theory. In particular I will ensure that: 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item variables are being used in the right context. 
		\item any discretization of functions is performed accurately about the 
		origin. For example, equal step sizes in either directions. 
		\item functions from other packages are being used in the right 
		context. For example, some packages have different standards for 
		constants. Theoretical convention may square a constant while the code 
		may take the squared value directly as the constant. 
		\item the dimensions of the vectors and matrices are appropriate. For 
		example, multiplication of row with column versus column with row. Or 
		that rows in matrices are seperated with semi-colons. 
		\item ensure a varible is not accidently overwritten or cleared. 
	\end{itemize} 
	\item Code walkthrough: My supervisor and I will go through the code 
	together to ensure that: 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item I correctly implemented the mathematical theory and numerical 
		algorithms.
		\item I made the code manageable and maintainable for future use.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Appendix}

This is where you can place additional information.

\subsection{Symbolic Parameters}

The definition of the test cases will call for SYMBOLIC\_CONSTANTS.
Their values are defined in this section for easy maintenance.

\subsection{Usability Survey Questions}

	particular spectrum?
\end{itemize} 

\newpage
\subsection{Data Input Tables} 

The following data table is for test-Rin1. An "X" indicates no-input or 
incorrect input. Incorrect input is anything that is non-numerical (ie letters 
or symbols). 

\begin{table}[h!]
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
		\hline        
		Input ID& a& b & k & n& Result \\
		\hline
		I1     &1 &1 &0.9 &100 & Runs \\ \hline
		I2    &X &1 &0.9 &100 & Error \\ \hline
		I3    &1 &X &0.9 &100 & Error\\ \hline 
		I4    &1 &1 &X &100 &Error \\ \hline 
		I5     &1 &1 &0.9 &X &Error \\ \hline
		I6    &1 &1 &1 & 1.2& Error\\ \hline
		I7    &1 &1 &1.2 & 100&Error\\ \hline 
		I8    &1 &-1 &0.9 &100& Error \\ \hline
		I9     &-1 &2 &0.9 &100 & Runs \\ \hline
		I10    &1 &2 &0.99 &100 & Runs\\ \hline
		I11    &1 &3 &0.99 &500 & Runs \\ \hline 
		I12   &1 &1 &0 &200 &Runs  \\ 
		\hline
	\end{tabular}\\
	\caption{Prescribed input for testing Rin}
	\label{Table:D_1}
\end{table} 

The following table outlines the boundary value test cases that can be verified 
from previous literature. A 'V' means that the parameter is free to vary.
\begin{table}[h!]
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
		\hline        
		Boundary ID& a& b& k  \\
		\hline
		B1     &$\sqrt{b}$ &$a^{2}$ &V    \\ \hline
		B2    &$\sqrt{\frac{b}{k^{2}}}$ &$a^{2}k^{2}$ &V   \\ \hline
		B3    &V &V &0  \\ 
		\hline
	\end{tabular}\\
	\caption{Prescribed input for Rin}
	\label{Table:D_2}
\end{table} 

For these cases all of the eigenvalues, except for four of them, will be purely 
imaginary. The remaing four have the form: $\lambda = \frac{+}{-} \frac{1}{2} a 
(1+\sqrt{1-k^{2}})$ and $\lambda = \frac{+}{-} \frac{1}{2} a 
(1-\sqrt{1-k^{2}})$ for B1. \\ 
As for B2 the eigenvalues have the form:  $\lambda =  \frac{1}{2} a 
(\frac{+}{-}k+ i \sqrt{1-k^{2}})$ and $\lambda = \frac{1}{2} a 
(\frac{+}{-}k - i \sqrt{1-k^{2}})$. (source) \\ 
The plan is to run B1 with a=b=1 and k=0.999. B2 will be run with the same 
input. The expected eigenvalues were previously mentioned. 

\subsection{Software Verification Checklist} 

\begin{itemize}
	\item Does the software allow the user to fufill their responsibilities 
	(as outlined in the SRS)?
	\item Does the software fufill its intended responsibilities (see SRS)?
	\item Was the intended user able to use the software and interpret the 
	output for their research purposes?
	\item Are any of the system constraints violated (see SRS)?
\end{itemize}  

\subsection{Correct Matrix Form} 

test-NFR2a will ensure that the matrix for which the eigen values are 
calculated, E, is of the correct form. For any given input n, the matrix is 4n 
by 4n. It is of the form $ [A1 A2; A2 -A1] $ . Where $ A1 A2$ is the first row 
and $A2 -A1$ is the second row. A1 and A2 are matrices. A2 is a diagonal 2n by 
2n matrix and A1 is 2n by 2n and defined as follows: A1(i,j) = n/2 for 
(1,2),(2,3),... (2n-1,2n) and A1(i,j)=-n/2 for (2,1),(3,2) ... (2n,2n-1). 
A1(1,2n)=-n/2 and A1(2n,1)=n/2.
