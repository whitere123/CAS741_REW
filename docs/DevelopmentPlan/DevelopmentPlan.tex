\maketitle

The software being developed in this project is called \progname. It is the 
initial phase of my master's thesis project in applied mathematics with Dr. 
Dmitry Pelinovsky. We will use this software to discover clues in our 
analyitical study of rogue waves and the Non-Linear Schr\"{o}dinger equation.

\section{Team Meeting Plan} 

I will meet with Dr. Dmitry Pelinovsky in his office from 9:30-11:00AM every 
tuesday from September 1 2018 until December 11 2018. 

\section{Team Communication Plan} 

We will communicate via email and in person during our weekly meetings. 

\section{Team Member Roles} 

Dmitry Pelinovsky is the master's thesis supervisor. Robert White is his 
master's student.

\section{Git Workflow Plan} 

The git workflow plan was outlined by Dr. Spencer Smith in his CAS 741 class. 
Documents will be periodically pushed into the github repository 
\url{https://github.com/whitere123/CAS741_REW}. Feedback from our CAS 741 
colleagues 
will be presented as issues shortly following a document submission. The final 
documentation and code is to be pushed into github on December 10, 2018. The 
plan begins with the submission of a problem statement followed by peer edits. 
This process is repeated every other week with the SRS, design, VnV Plan and 
VnV report. These documents and issues can be found in the previously mentioned 
github repository.

\section{Proof of Concept Demonstration Plan} 

The project was approved by Dr. Dmitry Pelinovsky and Dr. Spencer Smith from 
McMaster university.

\section{Technology} 

The software will be created using MATLAB and should run on a machine running 
the windows operating system.

\section{Coding Style} 

The coding style followed the standard's of my thesis supervisor and his 
colleagues in numerical analysis. Since the code is important for their 
research purposes, and is not too computationally heavy, it was not necessary 
for the code to follow any outside standards or templates. This coding style 
was driven by the nonfunctional requirement of being maintainable by my 
supervisor and his colleagues.

\section{Project Review} 

Reviews of the project have been presented as issues in 
\url{https://github.com/whitere123/CAS741_REW}. The final project will be 
critqued by Dr. Spencer Smith.
