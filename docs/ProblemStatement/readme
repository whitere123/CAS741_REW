This directory is home to the Problem Statement. The problem statement is written in latex. The .tex and .pdf files for the problem statement are here.  
  
The problem statement should:  
-> identify what problem we are trying to solve  
-> not say how we are going to solve the problem  
-> explain why the problem is important  
-> detail the context of the problem (stakeholders, software environment, etc..)  
-> not surpass a page in length
