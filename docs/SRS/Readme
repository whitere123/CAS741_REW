The outline of the SRS was created by Dr.Spencer Smith. It can be found in his gitlab repository.  
SRS stands for Specific System Requirements. 
The purpose of this document is to describe the requirements. 
This abstract document will explain the mathematical models, assumptions, 
solution characterisitcs and goals of the software. After reading this doucment 
one should be able to understand the mathematical and physical context of the 
inputs and outputs. They should also be able to identify the constraints of the 
system and have an idea as to how the output is derived from the given input.  
The SRS is meant to be unambigious and will not provide a detailed explanation 
of the numerical solution or code. 
The SRS details the quality attributes of the software, such as functionality, 
without dicussing any code, numerical algorithms or scientific computing 
solutions. It is a precursor to the documents required in the development of 
scientific software. One should read and understand this document before the 
VnV, design or code itself.
